# genalgo

A bioinformatics library for Scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shadaj/genalgo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shadaj/genalgo)

## For demo and documentation see <http://genalgo.shadaj.me>

The library is published for both Scala and Scala.js, so you can use it not only at your server but also in the browser. Common code is placed in the `shared` folder, which is symlinked into the `js` and `jvm` folders. Both `js` and `jvm` contain platform specific code.
